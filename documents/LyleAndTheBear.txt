Lyle and the Bear

Once upon a time, there was a bear. He was a hungry bear. He was so hungry that he left the comfort of the woods and headed into town. When he arrived, naturally, all the people fled the town, for they were afraid of the bear.

But there was one person who was not afraid. His name was Lyle. Lyle greeted the bear, hands waving in the air.

"Ho, Mr. Bear! Greetings."

"Hello, Mr. Human."

"Call me Lyle. What can I do for you?"

"I'm hungry. Really hungry."

"Okay."

"Yeah, well, that's it. I'm just hungry."

Lyle started laughing. Then the bear started laughing. They both laughed so hard and so long that they both forgot about the bear's hunger and then they became best friends.

The end.
