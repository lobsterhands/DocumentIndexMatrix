Happiness is a Virtue
By Lyle Denman

"Mom," cried Sally. There was no response for a moment.

"Mother!" Still nothing.

"Mamamamamamamma!" Silence.

Sally began to cry. Tears streamed down her face and she looked totally ugly crying that hard.

"Maaaaaaa," she screamed. She screamed so loud and shrill that the windows in the house shattered. Amazed at herself, she stopped screaming. She then stopped crying. She began to dry her eyes.

Just then, Sally's mother opened the front door. She was holding grocery bags.

"Oh, Sally, look at this mess. Have you been crying again?"

"Mmmmhm," Sally noised, then she sniffled.

"Sally, how many times do I have to tell you that happiness is a virtue?"

The end.
